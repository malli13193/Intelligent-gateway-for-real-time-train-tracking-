# Intelligent-gateway-for-real-time-train-tracking
Human development is directly related to the transport facility. India has been starting its transport through railways since 19th century. The Indian railway system is very big and very complicated. When generation moves forward, the technology and complexity are also moves to its higher levels. Now days, there is no exact communication between Indian railways and passengers. When the passenger wants to know the exact position of the train he may not get it because we didn't have any tracking equipment. When the train leaves the station then the station master immediately gives the information to the Gate man and next station. The gate man doesn't know any details regarding the exact position. If the train gets any internal or external issues then it creates a traffic issue at gate. In this project we will solve the traffic issue and provides the exact position of the train by using GPS. The communication between the train and passenger made through SMS. The second objective of this project is to provide an automatic spike control at a level crossing replacing the gates operated by the gatekeeper. It deals with two things. Firstly, it deals with the reduction of time for which the gate is being kept closed. Secondly, to reduce the traffic at the crossing and also provides emergency path for ambulance.
